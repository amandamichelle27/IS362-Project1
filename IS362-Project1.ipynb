Amwest has significantly more flights traveling to Phoenix, so its overall result is nearly as good as just Phoenix (89.1% versus 92%). However, because Alaska rarely flies into Phoenix, its overall results is quite a bit worse than just Phoenix (86.7% versus 94.8%).<br><br>\nIf each airport had the same number of flights, then Alaska would have the better overall statistics. However, because the weights of each destination are different per destination, the overall results can be misleading. This goes to show that it's always good to perform an in-depth analysis before jumping to conclusions."
